# 🎯 Auto-Save Job Application Features

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Save Job Applications**

When you submit job applications, the extension automatically:

- ✅ Saves the current URL to your tracker
- ✅ Sets status to "applied"
- ✅ Records timestamp when applied
- ✅ Shows success notification

### 2. **Enhanced URL Tracker Button**

- ✅ Fixed "Open URL Tracker" button in popup.html
- ✅ Added error handling and debugging
- ✅ Opens dashboard at http://localhost:5173

## 🔧 How Auto-Save Works

### Detection Methods:

1. **Form Submissions** - Detects job application forms being submitted
2. **Button Clicks** - Recognizes "Apply Now" type buttons
3. **Success Pages** - Monitors for application confirmation pages
4. **URL Changes** - Tracks navigation to success/confirmation URLs

### Keywords Detected:

- **Buttons**: "Apply Now", "Submit Application", "Apply for Position", "Quick Apply", "Easy Apply"
- **Forms**: Contains "apply", "application", "resume", "cv", "job", "position"
- **Success Pages**: "Application submitted", "Thank you for applying", "Application received"

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Page: `test.html`

1. Open `test.html` in Chrome with extension loaded
2. Login with: `test@example.com` / `testpassword123`
3. Click any "Apply Now" button on mock job listings
4. Should see green notification: "✅ Job application saved and marked as applied!"

### Expected Behavior:

- ✅ URL automatically saved to tracker
- ✅ Status set to "applied"
- ✅ Timestamp recorded
