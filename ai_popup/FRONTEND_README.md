## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- AI Form Assistant backend running (optional - has fallback demo mode)

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:

   ```bash
   cd ai_popup
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal)

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to work with the AI Form Assistant backend API. It expects these endpoints:

### Authentication

- `POST /api/login` - User login

  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }
  ```

- `POST /api/signup` - User registration
  ```json
  {
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }
  ```

### File Uploads

- `POST /api/upload-resume` - Upload resume file
- `POST /api/upload-personal-info` - Upload personal information file

Both upload endpoints expect:

- `file`: The uploaded file (multipart/form-data)
- `user_id`: User identifier
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

### Demo Mode

If the backend is not available, the frontend automatically falls back to demo mode:

- Mock authentication with demo credentials
- Simulated file uploads
- All functionality works for testing purposes

### API Configuration

Update the API base URL in `src/services/authService.ts`:

const API_BASE_URL = "http://your-backend-url/api";
```

### Demo Credentials

Modify demo users in `authService.ts` mockLogin function:

```typescript
const validUsers = [
  {
    email: "your@email.com",
    password: "yourpassword",
    id: "1",
    name: "Your Name",
  },
];
```

## Extension Integration

The dashboard provides:

1. **Download Link**: Pre-packaged extension as a zip file
2. **Installation Instructions**: Step-by-step Chrome extension setup
3. **File Uploads**: Resume and personal info for AI context

The uploaded files enhance the AI's ability to fill forms with relevant personal information.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login not working**:

   - Check if backend is running on port 8000
   - Use demo credentials for testing
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **File uploads failing**:

   - Ensure file types are supported (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify backend endpoints are available

3. **Extension download not working**:
   - Ensure `ai-popup-extension.zip` exists in `/public` folder
   - Check file permissions

### Development Issues

1. **Port conflicts**:

   - Frontend runs on port 5173 by default
   - Use `npm run dev -- --port 3000` for different port

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall if issues persist
